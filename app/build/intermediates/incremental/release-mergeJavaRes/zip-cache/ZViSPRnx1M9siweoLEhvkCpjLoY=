# Change Log

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200).

## [8.2.2] - 2016-04-08
- Falsy values can now be used as a text node in callback mode.

## [8.2.1] - 2016-04-07
- Falsy values can now be used as a text node. See 
[#117](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js/issues/117).

## [8.2.0] - 2016-04-01
- Removed lodash dependency to keep the library small and simple. See
[#114](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js/issues/114),
[#53](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js/issues/53),
and [#43](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js/issues/43).
- Added title case to name conversion options.

## [8.1.0] - 2016-03-29
- Added the callback option to the `begin` export function. When used with a
callback function, the XML document will be generated in chunks and each chunk
will be passed to the supplied function. In this mode, `begin` uses a different
code path and the builder should use much less memory since the entire XML tree
is not kept. There are a few drawbacks though. For example, traversing the document
tree or adding attributes to a node after it is written is not possible. It is
also not possible to remove nodes or attributes.

``` js
var result = '';

builder.begin(function(chunk) { result += chunk; })
  .dec()
  .ele('root')
    .ele('xmlbuilder').up()
  .end();
```

- Replaced native `Object.assign` with `lodash.assign` to support old JS engines.  See [#111](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js/issues/111).

## [8.0.0] - 2016-03-25
- Added the `begin` export function. See the wiki for details.
- Added the ability to add comments and processing instructions before and after the root element. Added `commentBefore`, `commentAfter`, `instructionBefore` and `instructionAfter` functions for this purpose.
- Dropped support for old node.js releases. Minimum required node.js version is now 4.0.

## [7.0.0] - 2016-03-21
- Processing instructions are now created as regular nodes. This is a major breaking change if you are using processing instructions. Previously processing instructions were inserted before their parent node. After this change processing instructions are appended to the children of the parent node. Note that it is not currently possible to insert processing instructions before or after the root element.
```js
root.ele('node').ins('pi');
// pre-v7
<?pi?><node/>
// v7
<node><?pi?></node>
```

## [6.0.0] - 2016-03-20
- Added custom XML writers. The default string conversion functions are now collected under the `XMLStringWriter` class which can be accessed by the `stringWriter(options)` function exported by the module. An `XMLStreamWriter` is also added which outputs the XML document to a writable stream. A stream writer can be created by calling the `streamWriter(stream, options)` function exported by the module. Both classes are heavily customizable and the details are added to the wiki. It is also possible to write an XML writer from scratch and use it when calling `end()` on the XML document.

## [5.0.1] - 2016-03-08
- Moved require statements for text case conversion to the top of files to reduce lazy requires.

## [5.0.0] - 2016-03-05
- Added text case option for element names and attribute names. Valid cases are `lower`, `upper`, `camel`, `kebab` and `snake`.
- Attribute and element values are escaped according to the [Canonical XML 1.0 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xml-c14n-20000119.html#charescaping). See [#54](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js/issues/54) and [#86](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js/issues/86).
- Added the `allowEmpty` option to `end()`. When this option is set, empty elements are not self-closed.
- Added support for [nested CDATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDATA#Nesting). The triad `]]>` in CDATA is now automatically replaced with `]]]]><![CDATA[>`.

## [4.2.1] - 2016-01-15
- Updated lodash dependency to 4.0.0.

## [4.2.0] - 2015-12-16
- Added the `noDoubleEncoding` option to `create()` to control whether existing html entities are encoded.

## [4.1.0] - 2015-11-11
- Added the `separateArrayItems` option to `create()` to control how arrays are handled when converting from objects. e.g.

```js
root.ele({ number: [ "one", "two"  ]});
// with separateArrayItems: true
<number>
  <one/>
  <two/>
</number>
// with separateArrayItems: false
<number>one</number>
<number>two</number>
```
